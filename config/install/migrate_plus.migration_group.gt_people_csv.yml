source_type: CSV or JSON files

# Here we add any default settings common to the migration group.
#
# For this example, the source tables are in the Drupal (default) database,
# but usually if your source data is in a database it will be external.
# In this case we have no such common settings, so I leave this parameter
# commented out.
# shared_configuration:

# As with the migration config (see migrate_plus.migration.node_program.yml),
# we specify that this migration group depends on the c11n_migrate module.
# Hence, when the c11n_migrate module is uninstalled, this migration group
# will also be removed from the system.
